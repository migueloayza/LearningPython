# LearningPython

We are a group of friends learning python from the official Python Tutorial. In addition, we will develop an introduction to the Python-based scientific ecosystem called SciPy. The aim of this group is to learn the tools for the development of computational physics (solutions, data analysis, simulations, etc.) in Python.
